## Transfer Learning application

This is my completion of an exercise from Udacity.com.
My part consisted in applying my knowledge of transfer learning to get a dog classifier.
I transferred learning from the Xception classifier using the Keras library.
I obtained 80% accuracy.
This is much better than the previous convolutional layer network that I implemented, which had 7% accuracy.

 
The code requires a lot of files to run, files like images, that are not stored on this repo.
Follow the first part of the instructions (INSTRUCTIONS.md) to find them. After that, run the Jupyter notebook dog_app.ipynb.
Alternatively, if you just want to see the code and the results without actually running it, simply open dog_app.html.
